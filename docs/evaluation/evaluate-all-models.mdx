# Evaluate All Models

By default, the `eval` command will evaluate all models in your configuration file and get a summary of the results.

The summary will be displayed in the terminal, showing all pass and fail tests and also saved to a file in the `evals/{dataset_name}/` directory.

## Example

```bash
thabit eval --dataset-name=unicode-text
```
